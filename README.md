Metaliteracy Augmented Reality Quest: a tool to teach students how to conduct great research

## Project Description
The project aims to create an app using augmented reality to teach students how to conduct quality research to solve real world problems as well as teach some of RPI's history, all while wrapping it in a fun game that will engage the participants.

The experience is delivered as a “quest” where students will explore the Folsom Library and perform research to solve a major problem in the world. Along the way they will meet characters representing famous alumni of RPI that will aid in their task. Through the work in this game the students will learn research skills that will aid them throughout their academic and working careers.

This repository will host the source code for the game which will be implemented with [argon.js](https://github.com/argonjs/argon). Currently, the project is in the design phase and development is limited.
